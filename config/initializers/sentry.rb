# Sentry SDK pointed at the self-hosted GlitchTip instance

# This initializer is a hard no-op when SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND is unset, which keeps
# development and test quiet without any extra config. In production/staging, set
# SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND as an environment variable (Zimmer deploys via the DigitalOcean
# + Tailscale GitHub Actions workflow and docker compose; the deploy passes it
# through Terraform when the secret is present). Point it at your own GlitchTip
# project so Zimmer's errors are isolated and independently alertable.
